            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>In my journey as a Python developer, I have successfully completed numerous projects that showcase my proficiency in this versatile programming language. Python has become my tool of choice for its simplicity, readability, and powerful libraries. As I continue to evolve in the world of programming, I've set my sights on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. DSA forms the foundation of efficient and optimized coding, enabling me to tackle complex problems and create more robust software solutions. With my Python expertise firmly established, I am excited to embark on this new phase of my learning journey, combining the elegance of Python with the logical rigor of DSA to solve real-world challenges effectively.</p>

            <h3>C++</h3>
            <p>Having successfully completed a comprehensive curriculum in C++ programming, I am now eager to embark on a new journey focused on Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. My proficiency in C++ has provided me with a strong foundation in programming concepts and problem-solving skills. I am excited to apply this knowledge to Python, a versatile and widely-used language, to explore the world of Data Structures and Algorithms. Through this transition, I aim to enhance my problem-solving capabilities and further expand my skill set in the realm of software development.</p>
